<!--Chapter 4: Getting Started with React -->

<!-- To use React in your newly created project, load two React scripts from an external website called unpkg.com:

react is the core React library.
react-dom provides DOM-specific methods that enable you to use React with the DOM. -->

<!-- <html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      const app = document.getElementById('app');
      const header = document.createElement('h1');
      const text = 'Develop. Preview. Ship.';
      const headerContent = document.createTextNode(text);
      header.appendChild(headerContent);
      app.appendChild(header);
    </script>
  </body>
</html> -->

<!-- Instead of directly manipulating the DOM with plain JavaScript, remove the DOM methods that you had added previously, and add the ReactDOM.createRoot() method to target a specific DOM element and create a root to display your React Components in. Then, add the root.render() method to render your React code to the DOM. -->

<!-- What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax. The nice thing about JSX is that apart from following three JSX rules, you don't need to learn any new symbols or syntax outside of HTML and JavaScript.

But browsers don't understand JSX out of the box, so you'll need a JavaScript compiler, such as a Babel, to transform your JSX code into regular JavaScript. -->

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <!-- Babel Script -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/jsx">
      const domNode = document.getElementById('app');
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(domNode);
      root.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- You can start to see how using React enables you to cut down a lot of repetitive code.

And this is exactly what React does, it's a library that contains reusable snippets of code that perform tasks on your behalf - in this case, updating the UI. -->
